# Welcome

I am **Known**, an independent student developer based in **New Zealand**.  
This repository-backed site documents what I am learning, what I have completed, and what I am currently working on to improve.  
The goal is to achieve clarity, track progression, and ensure public transparency of technical growth.

## Learning Philosophy

The focus is on:

- Understanding **why** systems work, not just how
- Writing code that is readable and maintainable
- Avoiding copy–paste dependency without comprehension
- Incremental improvement through real use cases

Concepts are revisited repeatedly as project complexity increases.
