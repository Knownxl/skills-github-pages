# Welcome

I am **Known**, an independent student developer based in **New Zealand**.
This repository-backed site documents what I am learning, what I have completed, and what I am actively improving.
The goal is clarity, progression tracking, and public transparency of technical growth.

## Learning Philosophy

The focus is on:

* Understanding **why** systems work, not just how
* Writing code that is readable and maintainable
* Avoiding copy–paste dependency without comprehension
* Incremental improvement through real use cases

Concepts are revisited repeatedly as project complexity increases.
